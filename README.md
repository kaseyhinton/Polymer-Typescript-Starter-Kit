# Polymer Typescript Starter Kit

This is a clone from the polymer starter kit. https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit
The only difference is the use of typescript, gulp, and browsersync.

### Setup

##### Prerequisites

    npm install -g polymer-cli
    npm install -g bower

##### Initialize project from template

    git clone https://github.com/kaseyhinton/Polymer-Typescript-Starter-Kit.git
    cd polymer-typescript-starter-kit
    bower install
    npm install

### Start the development server
    
    This command watches the html and js files in the src file and updates
    the browsers. The typescript should compile on save.

    gulp

### Build

    polymer build

### Preview the build

    polymer serve build/unbundled

    polymer serve build/bundled
    
### Run tests
    
    polymer test

### Adding a new view

You can extend the app by adding more views that will be demand-loaded
e.g. based on the route, or to progressively render non-critical sections of the
application. Each new demand-loaded fragment should be added to the list of
`fragments` in the included `polymer.json` file. This will ensure those
components and their dependencies are added to the list of pre-cached components
and will be included in the `bundled` build.
